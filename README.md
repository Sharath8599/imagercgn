# Image Recognition and Prediction Project

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks and Python scripts for an image recognition project. The project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and the `dlib` library for tasks such as image prediction and face recognition.

## Features

  - **Image Prediction**: A trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is used to classify and predict the content of images.
  - **Face Recognition**: Implements face detection and recognition using the `dlib` library.
  - **Project Documentation**: Includes a document outlining the project's security-related application.

## Repository Structure

  - `cnn (project).ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook likely used for building, training, and evaluating the CNN model.
  - `image prediction.ipynb`: A notebook dedicated to performing image prediction using the trained model.
  - `Untitled.ipynb`: An additional notebook, possibly for testing or scratch work.
  - `face_recognition_nocomment.py`: A Python script for face recognition.
  - `cnn.h5`: The pre-trained CNN model saved in HDF5 format. This is ready for use in prediction tasks.
  - `dlib_face_recognition_resnet_model_v1.dat`: A pre-trained model file from the `dlib` library for face recognition.
  - `smartsecurity.docx`: A Microsoft Word document detailing the project's application, potentially for a "smart security" system.


## Technologies

  - **Python**: The core programming language.
  - **Jupyter Notebook**: Used for developing and documenting the code.
  - **TensorFlow/Keras**: Inferred from the use of the `.h5` model file format for the CNN.
  - **dlib**: A library used for the face recognition functionality.
